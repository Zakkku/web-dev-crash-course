    <h3>Why I'm learning to code:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I wanna make over $100,000 a year</li>
        <li>I like making cool stuff</li>
        <li>I want skills that are in high demand and very difficult to obtain, making me not only a valuable asset to a
            company but giving me the ability to make my own company / work for myself with those skills if I want to in
            the future</li>

        <li>I want companies to beg for me to work for them instead of me begging for higher salaries from the company I
            work for</li>
        <li>I don't want to be an easily replaceable worker</li>
        <li>I don't want to feel trapped at my job. If I don't like it, I want to be able to quit or change companies
            easily and not have any financial difficulties</li>
        <li>I want the potential to work fully remote</li>
        <li>I want the potential to work freelance while still making over $100,000 a year</li>
        <li>I want the potential to work at a FAANG company someday, even if it's only for a year or two</li>
        <li>I want the peace of mind knowing that every second of work I'm doing at my job will directly translate into
            future earning potential increasing with essentially no limit</li>
    </ul>
